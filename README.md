# Pong Game JavaScript Implementation

Welcome to the Pong game JavaScript implementation repository! This project provides a simple yet fully functional version of the classic Pong game using JavaScript. It's designed to serve as both a starting point for building new games and as a learning resource for JavaScript game development.

## How to Play

Pong is a one-player game where player controls a paddle. The objective is to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle to score a point. The first player to reach a certain number of points wins the game.

### Controls

- Player 1 (Down Paddle):
  - Move Right: Move your mouse Right to move the paddle Right.
  - Move Left: Move your mouse Left to move the paddle Left.

- Player 2 - Computer (Up Paddle)
